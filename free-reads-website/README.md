# Welcome to the project

## About this project

I created this website to showcase its functionality and design. You can edit and explore it in several ways.

**Use the online editor**

Changes made via the online editor will be committed automatically to this repo.

**Use your preferred IDE**

You can also work locally using your own IDE by cloning this repo and pushing changes. Any pushed changes will also be reflected online.

The only requirement is having Node.js & npm installed - [install with nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating)

Follow these steps:

```sh
# Step 1: Clone the repository using the project's Git URL.
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>

# Step 2: Navigate to the project directory.
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>

# Step 3: Install the necessary dependencies.
npm i

# Step 4: Start the development server with auto-reloading and an instant preview.
npm run dev
```
